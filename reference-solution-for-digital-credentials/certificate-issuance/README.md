<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Certificate Issuance portal is being envisioned as a means to simplify the process of creating and issuing digital certificates. The portal provides a centralized platform for managing digital certificates, empowering the organizations with capabilities to create and issue certificates to individuals. It allows issuers to select a template for their digital certificates and then issue them to individuals.&#x20;

Issuers can select a pre-designed template available in the issuance portal for their certificates or can create their own custom template. This allows issuers to customize their certificates to their specific needs, including adding their own branding, logos, and information. Once the template is finalized, it can be saved and used for future certificate issuances.

Once the template is finalized, issuers can issue the certificates to the individuals. This involves entering the necessary information about the recipient, as per the schema decided by the issuer while finalizing the certificate. Once the information is entered, the certificate can be generated and issued to the recipient.
