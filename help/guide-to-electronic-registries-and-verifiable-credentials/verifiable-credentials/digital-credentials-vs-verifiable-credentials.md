# Digital Credentials vs Verifiable Credentials

| Digital Credentials                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Verifiable Credentials                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| A digital credential is a digital representation of a qualification, achievement, or other form of evidence of learning or experience. It can be used to demonstrate a person's skills, knowledge, and achievements. | A verifiable credential is a type of digital credential that is designed to be shared and verified in a secure and decentralized manner.  These are issued by trusted entities & include cryptographic proof that they have not been tampered with. |
| Digital credentials are not always verifiable. They may be issued in a format that is difficult to verify, such as a PDF or image file.                                                                              | Verifiable credential includes a digital signature that enables anyone to verify its authenticity and integrity.                                                                                                                                    |
| Digital credentials may be shareable, but they are often tied to a specific platform or system thus make it difficult to share across the platforms.                                                                 | Verifiable credentials can be easily shared and verified across different platforms and systems, making them highly interoperable.                                                                                                                  |
| Digital credentials may be vulnerable to fraud or tampering. Thus, there are high chances of forgery and documentation fraud.                                                                                        | Verifiable credentials, on the other hand, are designed to be secure and tamper-proof, using cryptographic methods to ensure their authenticity.                                                                                                    |
