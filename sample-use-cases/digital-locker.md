    I would like to manage the issuance of certificate at one place.
3.  \*\*Accepting Party/3rd Party: \*\*

    (WIP)I would like to access documents of my customer easily, so that I can review and process the next steps of my customer’s claim…

### **User Flows (Issuer)**

* Issuance Flow
  1.  Type 1 (Upload data)

      Issuers who are not digital can get onboarded fast - by using upload functionality
  2.  Type 2 (Issuance system)

      Issuer uses Sunbird RC’s issuer system to issue certificate
  3.  Type 3 (API endpoint)
