# Skills & Work Credentials

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1) (1).png>)

This reference solution provides a starting point to create a platform to allow people to collect credentials related to their skills, work experience , share them & get them verified digitally to get related benefits.

Currently we have have envisaged providing the following type of credentials

* Training Credential : Proof or Training Attended
* Skill Credential : Proof of Skills showcased/assessed
* Work Credential : Proof of Work Done/ Employment
* Reputation Credential : Proof or reputation using a verified review/rating

## User Flow

**User Personas**

* **Institue/ Skill center Admin**
* **Attndee / Student**
* **Industry Admins**



**The following Demo Scenario has been developed.**

ACT #1 Pulse Skilling Center in Nashik registers with the National Skill Registry Platform

ACT #2 Pulse Skilling Center registers the courses they offer on the platform one of which is Laser sheet metal cutting

Act #3 Mohandas attends a course on Laser Sheet Metal cutting at Pulse Skilling Center. (offline/online)

Act #4 Mohandas enrols on the National Skill Platform Registry or Pulse Skilling Center does the enrolment on his behalf.

Act #5 Pulse issues Mohandas Digital Training Credential on completing the course via the National Skill Registry Platform.

Act #6 Mohandas completes a series of exams which include theory as well as practicals & is issued a Digital Skill Credential

Act #7 Mohandas applies for a Job at Krishna Industries in Nashik. Krishna Industries validates his training & skill credentials & confirms his appointment letter.

Act #8 Mohandas completes 3 Years & decides to move to Coimbatore.

\#Act 9A Krishna Industries issues Mohandas a Digital Work Credential that certifies the fact that Mohandas worked with them for 3 years.

\#Act 9B In addition, due to exemplary skill demonstrated by Mohan, Krishna Industries also issues a Digital Reputation Credential to Mohandas.

\#Act 10 Mohandas applies for a job in Coimbatore at a tooling company called SPK Engineering Works.

\#Act 11 SPK Engineering works as part of its validation process validated all the digital credentials supplied by Mohandas & was able to onboard Mohandas quicker with a less intensive testing & interview process. You can discuss & give feedback about this use-case in the Discussions Area here.

**Of the above, the initial Pilot Demo covers Training & Skill Credentials. (Act#1 Act#7)**
