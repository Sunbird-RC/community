# Enrolment

The registry allows subjects to enrol, along with appropriate workflows for adding claims and getting them attested. Some claims may be automatically attested (eg: Aadhaar verification or GST number verification). Others may be manually attested.

### **Examples**

In case of a educational registry, Students, Teachers and Institutes (i.e. registrars or deans acting on behalf of the institute) are the subjects that may enrol in the registry

In case of a Blood Donor registry, Donors and Blood Banks would be the subjects that may enrol.
