**Contribute Features & Bug fixes**\
Head over to [Github](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC) and send in your pull requests for new features & bug fixes. For new features, add an Issue as a 'Requests for Comments (RFC) to get community feedback on feature ideas & approaches&#x20;

**Contribute & help others on the Discussions**\
****Help answer questions & guide adopters on the [discussion board](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/community/discussions)

**Implement reference solutions & use cases **\
****Have a great idea where Sunbird-RC can be useful ? Add it to the documentation as a Use case. Even better if you can deploy your own copy of Sunbird-RC & add it to the reference solutions & demos section

**Help improve this documentation**\
****This documentation is a collaboration & is managed via Github. The [community](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/community) repository on Github can be used to contribute to documentation.&#x20;
