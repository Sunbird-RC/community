## Contribute To The Core Registry

A contributing guide for the core registry does not exist as of now. PRs adding this are welcome!

## Contribute To The Registry CLI

Take a look at the [contributing guide for the Registry CLI](https://github.com/Sunbird-RC/sunbird-rc-core/blob/main/tools/cli/contributing.md) and jump straight into fixing bugs or adding new features!

The documentation is just a bunch of Markdown files in the [`community`](https://github.com/sunbird-rc/community/) repository. Feel free to open a PR that:

* makes the docs clearer/easier to understand
* fixes typos
* adds a section about something new
* adds something that was previously left out of docs
