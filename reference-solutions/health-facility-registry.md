# Health Facility Registry

Health Facility Registry acts as a  comprehensive repository of all healthcare facilities in the country. This registry shall encompass both public and private heath facilities ranging from hospitals and clinics to diagnostic laboratories, imaging centers, pharmacies and more. It  includes the data needed to unambiguously identify each facility such as facility name, unique facility identifier, location, and contact information, as well as administrative data to help categorize facilities, such as facility type, ownership and operational status. It may also include information about the service capacity of the facility, for example, type of services offered and number of beds. The Health Facility Registry plays a crucial role in efficiently organizing healthcare resources, promoting accessibility to services, and fostering trust and transparency within the healthcare ecosystem.
