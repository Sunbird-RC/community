# Unified Learners Passport (ULP)

## Vision

To revolutionize the way educational credentials are accessed, shared, and trusted in India

## Problem Statement

In the current scenario, students face a series of barriers in accessing growth opportunities (such as jobs, internships, scholarships, courses, competitions etc).  They are often required to present proof of their degree/diploma attainment, academic or non-academic achievements, etc. On top of that, ‘trust’ in these proofs often needs to be established, and is not inherent. Hence, significant time and effort is required from both students and the ecosystem - institutions, employers, government etc, in verifying the authenticity of the required documents.&#x20;

Learners’ key obstacles:

1. Non-shareable student records
2. Time consuming verification process

Ecosystem players face the following obstacles:

3. Inability to reach eligible students&#x20;
4. Time consuming verification process

## Personas

ULP, in educational context, involves 3 main personas who form the basic ecosystem -

* Issuer: The Issuer persona represents institutions such as schools and colleges responsible for issuing credentials.Key Characteristics:
* Learner: The Learner persona represents the students who utilize the ULP platform to receive, view, and share their credentials. They can easily access their credentials, showcase them to potential opportunity providers, and share verified information to establish their qualifications.
* Verifier: The Verifier persona represents benefit providers, such as employers, scholarship organizations, etc, who need to verify the credentials presented by learners.

## Solution

The above-mentioned challenges can be solved through implementation of digital credentials of a learner’s experience and achievements, which can be accessed and shared easily by the learner, with trust being an inherent property of each credential.

The proposed solution is Universal Learner's Passport (ULP)

ULP will provide learners with a comprehensive platform to consolidate and showcase their educational achievements, skills, and experiences. The platform will allow for seamless sharing of credentials, simplifying the verification process for both learners and opportunity providers.
