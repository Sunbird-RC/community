`git clone` [`https://github.com/Unified-Learner-Passbook/ref-automation.git`](https://github.com/Unified-Learner-Passbook/ref-automation.git)

&#x20;(this will be the Sunbird RC link once the code is merged)

Go to the specific directory where you have cloned the repository i.e. ref-automation Then perform the following command

`sudo chmod -R +x nginx.sh`

Export your\_domain= Example : (export your\_domain=test.automation.com) Then run the nginx.sh file ./nginx.sh



#### Step 2 - Setting Up the services

After installing certificates to the domain go to a specific directory i.e. ref-automation And perform the following command

`sudo docker-compose up -d`

Once all the containers are up and running then perform the below commands step by step

And exit the container Perform the following command in the terminal :

`sudo docker restart credential_ms cred_schema_ms_service did_l3_service`
