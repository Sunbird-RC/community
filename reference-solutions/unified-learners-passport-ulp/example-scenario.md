# Example Scenario

As an example scenario, consider a case of an NGO distributing textbooks to students in classes 1-5 of government schools in a State. In this scenario:

* The school acts as the issuer, responsible for certifying the eligibility of students to receive textbooks.
* The students are the learners who require credentials certifying their eligibility.
* The NGO serves as the verifier, responsible for verifying the credentials and facilitating the distribution of books based on the verification result.

In this example activity, the school issues a credential certifying a student's eligibility to receive textbooks. The NGO verifies the credential using ULP's verification capability. Based on the verification result, the NGO carries out the activity of distributing books to the eligible students.
