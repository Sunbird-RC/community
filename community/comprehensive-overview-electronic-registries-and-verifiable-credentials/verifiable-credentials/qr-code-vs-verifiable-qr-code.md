# QR code vs Verifiable QR code

## Let's first understand What is a QR code?

A QR code, short for Quick Response code, is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned by a QR code reader or smartphone camera to retrieve information.

QR codes can contain various types of data, such as website URLs, text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more.

QR codes are widely used in marketing, advertising, and other industries as a way to quickly provide information to customers or users. They are also used for contactless payment systems, where customers can scan a QR code to make a payment without physically swiping or inserting a credit or debit card.

QR codes are easy to create and can be printed on a paper, plastic, and metal. They can also be displayed on electronic screens, such as smartphones, tablets, and computer monitors.

| Normal QR codes may contain digital credentials, which are digital representations of qualifications, achievements, or evidence of learning or experience. These credentials can be embedded within the QR code to provide information about the individual's skills, knowledge, or accomplishments. However, it's important to note that digital credentials in normal QR codes lack the built-in mechanisms for verification and cryptographic proof found in verifiable QR codes. As a result, the authenticity and integrity of the digital credentials within normal QR codes may be more difficult to ascertain compared to verifiable QR codes. | Verifiable QR codes contain verifiable credentials, which are digital representations of qualifications, achievements, or evidence of learning or experience. These credentials are securely embedded within the QR code and include cryptographic proof of their authenticity. Verifiable credentials are issued by trusted entities and can be easily shared and verified across different platforms and systems. The presence of verifiable credentials in verifiable QR codes enhances their trustworthiness and ensures that the information contained within them can be reliably |
