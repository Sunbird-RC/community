**What is Sunbird RC?**

Sunbird RC (Registry and Credentials) is a "low code" framework to enable organizations to rapidly build next generation electronic registries and verifiable credentials. Sunbird RC uses a set of configurations to rapidly build out registries, automatically generate CRUD (create/ read/ update/ delete) APIs without any coding, enable registry searches and access via open APIs, issue and manage verifiable credentials, manage user consent flows if required, manage attestation and verification flows, etc.

Sunbird RC is listed as a global Digital Public Good (DPG) within the [Digital Public Good Alliance (DPGA) registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/). Sunbird RC is the core engine within [DIVOC](https://divoc.dev/), a globally recognized DPG for vaccination and health credentialing. Sunbird RC is also part of India's massively adopted [DIKSHA](https://diksha.gov.in/) school education platform used at population scale.

This is an independently usable digital building block and is part of overall [Sunbird](https://sunbird.org/) open-source initiative. Similar to various projects under Sunbird, this is also open sourced under MIT license and you are free to adopt for your purposes. We strongly encourage you to contribute back, participate in the community to help improve this project.

One of the most significant advantages of Sunbird RC is its privacy-preserving feature. Sunbird RC uses advanced cryptographic methods, such as digital signatures and encryption, to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure. This is critical in today's data-driven world, where data privacy and security are of paramount importance.

Another significant benefit of the Sunbird RC is its modular and configurable design. This feature allows implementers to tailor the platform to their specific needs and requirements, enabling them to use the platform efficiently and effectively. Sunbird RC also supports multiple languages and multi-cloud environments, making it easy to deploy and facilitate rapid roll-out.&#x20;

Sunbird RC also offers observability features that allow users to monitor the health and performance of the system. Basic telemetry and analytics are provided, enabling users to detect any issues or anomalies through audit and logs.

Sunbird RC is designed to handle large volumes of data and concurrent users, with the ability to sync and update data asynchronously, ensuring that the platform can scale as the data grows. See the Sunbird RC in action page for examples of where and how Sunbird RC is currently used.

**Features of Sunbird RC**

**1. Master Data Store:** Use the registry as a master data store of actors (people, entities or things)

* Vocabulary creation and modelling
* Employ flexible schema to define entity attributes and validations using JSON, JSON-LD
* Attach rules for data validation, lifecycle operations and relationships

**2. Data operations:** Issue data into, as well as read data from Registry

* Secure API driven CRUD operations&#x20;
* Data operations via secure, open APIs for data publishing and access, data discovery and search
* Key-value pair driven search, attribute search&#x20;

**3. Data protection:** Encryption and data security

* Data encryption and masking
* Support for custom encryption services - open end points to replace the bundled in encryption services with services of the adopters choice
* Audit trails and logging

**4. Single source of truth:** Employing the registry as a single source of truth for reliable data

* Digital signatures for trust worthiness and non-repudiation
* Open end points to replace the bundled in encryption services with services of the adopters choice

**5. Business led Database choice:** Ability to make a business led choice of database to the registry

* Support for multiple databases employing out-of-the-box adapters for multiple DB support - including graphs DBs(Neo4j), RDBMS(Postgres)
