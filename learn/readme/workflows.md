1. **User Registration/Onboarding**
   1. Self-Registration
   2. Register via Invitation
   3. Via integration with existing registries
2. **Verifiable Credentials Issuance:** Issuer of a verifiable credential creates the credential and digitally signs it using a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use.When the issuer digitally signs the credential, they generate a digital signature using their private key. The digital signature is attached to the credential and can be used by verifiers to confirm that the credential has not been altered since it was issued. The public key associated with the issuer's private key can also be included in the credential, allowing verifiers to verify the digital signature using the issuer's public key.
3. **Verifiable Credentials Storage:** Once a verifiable credential is issued, it is stored in the elockers/digital wallet or other digital storage system controlled by the credential holder. The digital wallet provides a secure and convenient way for the credential holder to manage and share their credentials with others.
4. **Verifiable Credentials Verification:** When a credential holder presents a verifiable credential to the accepting party/verifier, such as a potential employer, the verifier can verify the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic techniques. This involves verifying the digital signature of the issuer, which confirms that the credential has not been tampered with since it was issued.&#x20;
