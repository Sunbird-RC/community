# What issues will Verifiable Credentials address?

* Complex and time consuming traditional verification processes
* Lengthy and cumbersome manual document verification
* Fake Certificates leading to data misuse, record manipulation, fraud, scams, identity theft, and other criminal activities.
* Lack of transparency
* Lack of integrated mechanism for verifiability and security

To resolve the aforementioned challenges, Verifiable Credentials play a crucial role and offer several benefits:

* Verifiable Credentials help in automation, reducing time, effort, and cost. The information that a physical credential contains can also be represented by a verifiable credential.
* Verifiable credentials are more tamper-evident and reliable than physical credentials.
* They can be issued quickly and can be instantly presented to the organizations for the verification.
* Verifiable Credentials are private, and users can always choose what attributes of their identity they want to disclose.
* These can be verified everywhere, anytime instantly.

These benefits contribute to a more efficient and secure verification process, alleviating the issues associated with traditional methods.
