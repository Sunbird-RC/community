# What issues will Verifiable Credentials address?

Traditional verification processes are fraught with issues. They are increasingly complex and time-consuming, often requiring individuals to disclose more personal information than necessary. Manually verifying the authenticity of documents can be a lengthy and cumbersome process, especially when multiple documents are involved.

The rise of technology has made it easier than ever to create convincing fake documents, eroding trust in physical certificates and documents. This poses serious risks, as forged documents can lead to data misuse, record manipulation, fraud, scams, identity theft, and other criminal activities.

To resolve the aforementioned challenges, Verifiable Credentials play a crucial role and offer several benefits:

* Verifiable Credentials help in automation, reducing time, effort, and cost. The information that a physical credential contains can also be represented by a verifiable credential.
* Verifiable credentials are more tamper-evident and reliable than physical credentials.
* They can be issued quickly and can be instantly presented to the organizations for the verification.
* Verifiable Credentials are private, and users can always choose what attributes of their identity they want to disclose.
* These can be verified everywhere, anytime instantly.

These benefits contribute to a more efficient and secure verification process, alleviating the issues associated with traditional methods.
