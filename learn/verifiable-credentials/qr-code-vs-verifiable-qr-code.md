# QR code vs Verifiable QR code

## Let's first understand What is a QR code?

A QR code, short for Quick Response code, is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned by a QR code reader or smartphone camera to retrieve information.

QR codes can contain various types of data, such as website URLs, text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more.

QR codes are widely used in marketing, advertising, and other industries as a way to quickly provide information to customers or users. They are also used for contactless payment systems, where customers can scan a QR code to make a payment without physically swiping or inserting a credit or debit card.

QR codes are easy to create and can be printed on a paper, plastic, and metal. They can also be displayed on electronic screens, such as smartphones, tablets, and computer monitors.

| A normal QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that contains information that can be read using a QR code scanner or a smartphone camera. This information is usually a website URL. | A signed QR code encodes the verifiable data set or information within the QR itself, rather than on any website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| QR codes are susceptible to tampering and alteration, making the verification process untrustworthy and vulnerable to hacking.                                                      | Verifiable QR codes use digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data/information contained within them. When a verifiable QR code is scanned, the digital signature is verified to ensure that the data/information has not been altered or tampered with. This makes them more secure and trustworthy than normal QR code. |
| QR codes are a quick and convenient way to share information such as website details, contact details etc.                                                                          | Verifiable QR codes are used when the security and integrity of the data are of utmost importance. They are typically used for sensitive data, such as personal identification details, financial information, and medical records.                                                                                                                    |
