# What are Electronic Registries?

An electronic registry is a structured & live identification system that gathers, saves, and maintains uniformed updated data or information on an entity, such as a patient, person, employee, student, or facility, and is constantly updated to serve as the entity's "Single Source of Truth'' which is also verifiable.&#x20;

Registries function as a shared digital infrastructure foundational layer for national digital initiatives by facilitating a common source of verifiable data that can be utilized by any Govt or private entity or system with consent for execution of a digital initiative. Such registries enable consented subjects (people, entities, things) to enroll, manage their record with the necessary degrees of verification, and use third-party services that are built on it by using its authentication and KYC services.
