# Design Principles

### Principles

1. **Minimalism and Decentralisation (federated)**\
   Registries should be built for specific purposes containing just enough attributes for serving that purpose. Registries should leverage other existing registries, avoid creating multiple sources of truths, and allowing other federated linked registries to be built on top.
2. **Accountability & Non-repudiability**\
   Complexity is an inherent characteristic of large-scale ecosystems, and solutions can not be trusted and sustained if the authenticity of authorship and validity of contracts can be repudiated. Registry will enable non-repudiation of authorship and contracts as an embedded feature using user authentication and digital signatures.
3. **Empowerment & Self-maintainability**\
   \*\*\*\*Empowering data owners, by giving them the ability to view, initiate correction and control how their information is accessed or used, by giving them the ability to give and withdraw consent at the attribute level (consent-based architecture).
4. **Security & Consented Access**\
   \*\*\*\*Ensuring that data is exchanged in a secured manner with well defined privacy rules and in alignment with access allowed by data owner and issuer.
5. **Universal Access & Open APIs**\
   \*\*\*\*Enable secure digital access and interoperable communication across systems using APIs to ensure seamless integration across diverse systems.

Registries based on these principles will drive data accuracy and build trust in the system among the actors of the ecosystem.
