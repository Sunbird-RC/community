## Report Bugs/Request Features

Something not working correctly? Something feels wrong? Or want to see a new

[Open an issue](https://github.com/sunbird-rc/community/issues/new/choose)!

## Contribute To The Core Registry

A contributing guide for the core registry does not exist as of now. PRs adding
this are welcome!

## Contribute To The Registry CLI

Take a look at the
[contributing guide for the Registry CLI](https://github.com/sunbird-rc/sunbird-rc-core/blob/main/tools/cli/docs/contributing.md)
and jump straight into fixing bugs or adding new features!

## Improve Documentation

The documentation is just a bunch of Markdown files in the
[`community`](https://github.com/sunbird-rc/community/main/tree/latest). Feel
free to open a PR that:

- makes the docs clearer/easier to understand
- fixes typos
- adds a section about something new
- adds something that was previously left out of docs
