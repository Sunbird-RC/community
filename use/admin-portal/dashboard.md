# Dashboard

* The dashboard lets users view the structure they've created in the registry, along with certificates, schema count, and status information. It also offers the ability to explore APIs.&#x20;
* Using a sidebar, users can easily move between different steps in creating or modifying a schema. For example, clicking on a schema in the sidebar takes the user to a step where they can edit an existing schema in draft status or create a new one.
* When users click on "Explore API" here, they can examine the Swagger JSON representation of the published schema.&#x20;
* Additionally, there's a distinct card displaying schema details such as its name, count, and status. Within this card, users have the option to view the schema.&#x20;
* If the schema is in a "PUBLISHED" status, users can only view it in a read-only mode. However, if the schema is in "DRAFT" status, users have the ability not only to view but also to edit the schema.

* In the bottom section of the dashboard, users can find Verifiable Credentials (VC), which are certificate templates corresponding to each schema, as depicted in the above template.
* By clicking the "Add" button, users are directed to the "Add VC" step, where they can seamlessly add new certificates to the relevant schema.
* Moreover, users can interact with the certificate icons by clicking on them. This action allows users to both view and edit the certificate templates associated with the specific schema they are working on.
