# PostgreSQL

Regular backups of PostgreSQL databases are crucial for preserving valuable data. Although the process is relatively straightforward, it is essential to grasp the underlying methods and assumptions involved.

There are three distinct methods for backing up PostgreSQL data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

1. [SQL dump](sql-dump.md)
2. [File-system level backup](file-system-level-backup.md)
3. [Continuous archiving](continuous-archiving-and-point-in-time-recovery-pitr.md)

In the subsequent sections, we will discuss each approach individually, examining their respective strengths and weaknesses.
