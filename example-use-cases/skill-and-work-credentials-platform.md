# Skils & Work Credendials Platform

This reference solution provides a starting point to create a platform to allow people to collect credentials related to their skills, work experience , share them & get them verified digitally to get related benefits.&#x20;

Currently we have have envisaged providing the following type of credentials&#x20;

* Training Credential : Proof or Training Attended
* Skill Credential : Proof of Skills showcased/assessed&#x20;
* Work Credential : Proof of Work Done/ Employment
* Reputation Credential : Proof or reputation using a verified review/rating
