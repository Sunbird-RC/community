This reference solution provides a starting point to create a platform to allow people to collect credentials related to their skills, work experience , share them & get them verified digitally to get related benefits. Currently we have have envisaged providing the following type of credentials 
Training Credential : Proof or Training Attended Work Credential : Proof of Work Done/ EmploymentSkill Credential : Proof of Skills showcased/assessed Reputation Credential : Proof or reputation using a verified review/rating
The following Demo Scenario is currently being developed. 

ACT #1 Pulse Skilling Center in Nashik registers with the National Skill Registry Platform 
ACT #2 Pulse Skilling Center registers the courses they offer on the platform one of which is Laser sheet metal cutting 
Act #3 Mohandas enrols on the National Skill Platform Registry 
Act #4 Mohandas attends a course on Laser Sheet Metal cutting at Pulse Skilling Center. (offline/online) 
Act #5 Pulse issues Mohandas Digital Training Credential on completing the course via the National Skill Registry Platform. 
Act #6 Mohandas completes a series of exams which include theory as well as practicals & is issued a Digital Skill Credential 
Act #7 Mohandas applies for a Job at Krishna Industries in Nashik. Krishna Industries validates his training & skill credentials & confirms his appointment letter. 
Act #8 Mohandas completes 3 Years & decides to move to Coimbatore. 
#Act 9A Krishna Industries issues Mohandas a Digital Work Credential that certifies the fact that Mohandas worked with them for 3 years. 
#Act 9B In addition, due to exemplary skill demonstrated by Mohan, Krishna Industries also issues a Digital Reputation Credential to Mohandas. 
#Act 10 Mohandas applies for a job in Coimbatore at a tooling company called SPK Engineering Works. 
#Act 11 SPK Engineering works as part of its validation process validated all the digital credentials supplied by Mohandas & was able to onboard Mohandas quicker with a less intensive testing & interview process.
